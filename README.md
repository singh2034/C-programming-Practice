# C-programming-Practice
Some projects which is in progress.
If you find any thing in rotating-cube like errors related to SDLC error :- Fix it by installing the dependencies.
In Linux based systems :- sudo apt install libsdl2-dev (apt based systems i.e - Ubuntu, Debian etc.) use dnf or pacman for fedora or arch.
For Windows, find it your self and this is only for programming, otherwise you can use the software without any dependencies, mainly a graphic.
